This is a work in progress Terraform Provider to manage NATS JetStream.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **DEPRECATION NOTICE: This project will be deprecated after release 0.1.1 and will receive only bug fixes and security updates going forward.**
>
> There are two reasons for deprecation:
>
> - The primary one is that the NATS server currently has a limitation for supporting declarative-style configuration tools. Specifically, there are some APIs which result in an internal state change that causes the provider state to be implicitly out-of-sync. This is [being addressed in 2.11](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/4959)
> - The secondary reason is that the provider is written using an old version of the Terraform SDK and needs to be updated to be compatible with Terraform 1.18+
>
> Once NATS 2.11 is released, the intention is to re-write the provider using the latest Terraform SDK.

## Installation

When using Terraform 0.13 or newer adding the `provider` and running `terraform init` will download the provider from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nats-io/jetstream/latest/docs).

## Credentials

The provider supports NATS 2.0 credentials either in a file or as a Terraform Variable or Data, for local use you would set the credentials as in the examples later, but if you use something like Terraform Cloud or wish to store the credentials in a credential store you can use Terraform Variables:

```terraform
variable "ngs_credential_data" {
  type = string
  description = "Text of the NATS credentials to use to manage JetStream"
}

provider "jetstream" {
  servers = "connect.ngs.global"
  credential_data = var.ngs_credential_data
}
```

A locked down user that can only admin JetStream but not retrieve any data stored in JetStream looks like this:

Here's a command to create this using `nsc`, note replace the `DemoAccount` and `1M` strings with your account name and desired expiry time:

```
$ nsc add user -a DemoAccount
--expiry 1M \
--name ngs_jetstream_admin \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.CONSUMER.DELETE.*.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.CONSUMER.DURABLE.CREATE.*.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.*.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.CONSUMER.LIST.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.CONSUMER.NAMES.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.INFO' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.CREATE.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.DELETE.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.*' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.LIST' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.NAMES' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.TEMPLATE.>' \
--allow-pub '$JS.API.STREAM.UPDATE.*' \
--allow-sub '_INBOX.>'
```

This will create the credential in `~/.nkeys/creds/synadia/MyAccount/ngs_jetstream_admin.creds`
